**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** is a type of web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to make requests from the server-side application to an arbitrary destination. SSRF vulnerabilities occur when a server-side application processes user-supplied URLs or URIs in an insecure way, allowing attackers to abuse the functionality to:

1. Access internal resources (like private networks, services, and databases).
2. Enumerate internal network structures and services.
3. Bypass firewall rules.
4. Retrieve sensitive information, such as metadata from cloud instances.
5. Potentially gain remote code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.
